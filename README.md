# xmpp.hacked.is

This repository contains scripts and configs used for the xmpp.hacked.is server. Lunar tries to make it as transparent as possible, while hiding some secrets that run in the cron. Such as the script that injects usernames for admin accounts after a config update.

For more information about the server, check out our site: https://xmpp.is/ | https://xmpp.hacked.is
